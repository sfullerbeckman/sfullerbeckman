### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m Seth Fuller! (@sfullerbeckman), and I work at Beckmna Coulter Life Sciences (or Bec LS as some like to say ðŸ˜‰) Iâ€™m interested in all things web tech. I especially like investigating new web frameworks such as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Alghough not web tech, Iâ€™m currently learning WPF.
