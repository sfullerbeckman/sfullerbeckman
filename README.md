### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m Seth Fuller! (@sfullerbeckman), and I work at Beckman Coulter Life Sciences. Iâ€™m interested in all things web tech. I especially like investigating new web frameworks such as [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). Although not web tech, Iâ€™m also learning [WPF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/?view=netdesktop-5.0) and [Go](https://go.dev/)!. 

**What I do**: ðŸ”¬+ ðŸ’» = ðŸ˜®
